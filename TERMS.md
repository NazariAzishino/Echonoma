### 1. Usage
Echonoma is a Discord bot designed to assist with moderation and entertainment (e.g., games like chess). Additional features may be added in the future. Use of the Bot must comply with the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

### 2. Data Collection
The Bot may collect the following data when you interact with its features:
- User ID
- Server (Guild) ID
- Channel ID

This data is used solely for:
- Runtime operation
- Storing information related to specific features such as the ticketing system (e.g., remembering associated channels)

### 3. Data Storage
All data collected is stored locally using JSON files.

No data is shared with third parties.

The data is only used internally by the Bot to support and manage its features.

### 4. Third-Party Services
As of now, Echonoma does not use any third-party APIs or services. However, this may change in the future. If the Bot integrates with external services (e.g., Spotify API, AI APIs), the Terms of Service will be updated accordingly.

### 5. Prohibited Usage
You may not:
- Abuse or spam the Bot
- Exploit bugs or unintended behavior
- Use the Bot for illegal or malicious activities

Violation of these rules may result in being blocked from using the Bot permanently.

### 6. Minimum Age Requirement
You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum legal age in your jurisdiction, to use Echonoma. This follows the age restrictions defined by Discord.

### 7. Changes to the Terms
The Bot developer (Arishino) reserves the right to update or modify these Terms of Service at any time without prior notice. Major changes may be announced through the official GitHub repository or support server, if available.

### 8. Contact
For any questions, issues, or concerns regarding the Bot, please reach out via GitHub Issues or the official support server (if one is provided in the future).
